## Envscripts

This repo is a bit of a scratch folder but aims to contain all thats needed
to create a windows shell environment that is not too terrible to work with.

It has lots of convenience scripts and aliases that will be useful to none but me.
There are a few paths you'll want to change for things to work properly (just search for brennan)

A couple that are worth using though (they all respond to -h):

`alias` creates scripts in a manner similar to alias on linux. It cna also be used to list and view existing scripts.
`go2` is like a command line favourites so you can label useful places or quickly jump to a folder if it exists in a few places.
`getme` works like which/where commands except it numbers the options so you can simply rerun the command with the added number to continue
